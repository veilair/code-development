##### Question 1:

Find the most frequently occuring element in an array.

Example: The most frequently occuring item is [1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1] is 1.

If you are given an empty array, you should return null(in java) or None (in python)

You can assume that there is always a single, unique value that appears most frequently unless
the array is empty. For instance, you won't be given an array such as [1, 1, 2, 2


We are going to use lists instead of arrays in Python for simpllicity.
