##### Question 5:

Write a function that takes two strings and returns True if they are one away from each other.

They are one away from each other if a single operation (changing a character, deleting a character,
or adding a character) will change one of the strings to the other.

Example: "abcde" and "abcd" are one away (deleting a character)
