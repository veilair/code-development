##### Question 3:

Write a function that returns True if one array is a rotation of another.

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is a  rotation of [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]

NOTE: There are no duplicates in each of these arrays
REMINDER: We are going to use lists instead of arrays in Python for simpllicity.
